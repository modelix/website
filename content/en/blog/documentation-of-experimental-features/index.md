title: "Documentation of experimental features"
---

We, as the modelix team have decided how we want to release and communicate experimental features.

In summary, the published versions of components may contain experimental features, that will be annotated depending on the technology.

In TypeScript we use the [documentation tag `@experimental`](https://tsdoc.org/pages/tags/experimental/). For Kotlin we created a custom annotation for an [Opt-in requirement](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/opt-in-requirements.html).

You can read about it in more detail in our [documentation](https://docs.modelix.org/modelix/main/main/development.html#experimental_features)
